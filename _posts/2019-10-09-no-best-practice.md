Best implies no room for improvement. There is always a better practice. Much better, I believe.

Citing "Best Practice" is often a shortcut used to avoid debate about how we can do better.

I had one instance where a manager steadfastly rejected a suggestion. His reason for rejection? They were using "best practice." When pushed, he had no other justification than "it is best practice." I don't remember the details, but I do remember that when his boss heard the new suggestion, he said "of course we should do that! That is clearly better than what we've been doing!"

When you hear the words, "best practice," I encourage you to replace it with "good practice" and start searching for better. "Best practice" is a hint that the current practice may be due to be revised. Things may have changed in a way that allows for quick and easy improvement.

Instead of searching for "best practices," I prefer to search for "better practices." What's "Good Practice" today can be improved upon by a "Better Practice" tomorrow.
